Fine-Tuned Niche Content Generator
This web application showcases a fine-tuned transformer model for generating domain-specific content across niches like technical documentation, marketing copy, creative writing, and academic papers. Developed as my master's academic project in Mathematical Data Science at Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) Cottbus, it demonstrates AI adaptation techniques for specialized text generation.
​

Features
Niche Selection: Choose from tech, marketing, creative, academic, or legal domains to tailor output.
​

Custom Parameters: Adjust tone (professional, casual, persuasive), length (short, medium, long), and provide detailed prompts.
​

Interactive UI: Modern, responsive design with input forms, loading animations, copy/regenerate buttons, and example use cases.
​

Demo Content: Pre-loaded examples simulate fine-tuned outputs for quick testing (e.g., neural network explanations, coffee shop promotions).
​

Demo Architecture
The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a standalone, browser-based experience. Key components include:
​

Section	Purpose
Input Panel	Form for niche, prompt, tone, length selection 
​
Output Panel	Displays generated text with copy/export options 
​
Examples Grid	Clickable cards for common scenarios 
​
Model Info	Explains fine-tuning benefits like domain accuracy 
​
In production, it integrates with a backend API for actual fine-tuned models (e.g., via Hugging Face Transformers).
​

Learning Goals
As part of my Master's in Mathematical Data Science, this project explores:

Domain adaptation of transformer models on niche datasets.
​

UI/UX for AI content tools, emphasizing user-friendly parameters.
​

Simulation of fine-tuning workflows, preparing for generative AI internships.
​

Quick Start
Open app.html in any modern browser.

Select a niche and enter a prompt (or use examples).

Click "Generate Content" to see demo output.
​

Copy or regenerate as needed.

Future Enhancements
Backend integration with real fine-tuned models (e.g., GPT-J or Llama variants).

Support for more niches and multilingual generation.

Export to PDF/Markdown.

User authentication for saving prompts.

Technologies
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (custom gradients, animations), Vanilla JavaScript.
​

AI Concepts: Transformer fine-tuning simulation for domain-specific NLP.
